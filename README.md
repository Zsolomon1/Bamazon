# Bamazon
Homework assignment using MYSQL to perform a database that allows for product purchases similar to amazon

OVERVIEW

This application is formatted to take a Database identical to the original instructions. It takes a database named Bamazon, a table named Products, and the columns of ItemID, ProductName, DepartmentName, Price, and StockQuantity.

Right now I have the listed code for both the customer and the mysql account attached. This is an incomplete product at this time.
